print("WELCOME TO LIF PROGRAMMING!!!!")

# Steps to do:
# 0. Understand the equation (τm​dtdV​=−(V(t)−Vrest​)+Rm​I(t))!!! <----- WE ARE HERE
# 1. Figure out how to write the differential equation in python
# 2. Make it such that given a time (t), we can find all the other variables using the equation
# 3. Add the spiking logic to the code (whenever V goes above 1 we need to give a signal and then reset V to 0)
# 4. Use Matplotlib to visualize the working using a range of data
